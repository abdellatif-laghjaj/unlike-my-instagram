-   Comprehensive error logging without exposing sensitive data
-   Graceful script termination without data loss

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Method 1: Environment Variables (Recommended)

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Edit `.env` and fill in your credentials:

```bash
# Instagram Credentials
INSTAGRAM_USERNAME=your_username_here
INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD=your_password_here
INSTAGRAM_MFA_SECRET=your_mfa_secret_here

# Script Configuration
LIKE_REMOVAL_AMOUNT=1000
QUIET_MODE=false

# Performance Settings
MIN_DELAY=0.5
MAX_DELAY=1.2
BATCH_SIZE=50
```

### Method 2: System Environment Variables

Set environment variables in your system:

```bash
# Windows (Command Prompt)
set INSTAGRAM_USERNAME=your_username
set INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD=your_password

# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:INSTAGRAM_USERNAME="your_username"
$env:INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD="your_password"

# Linux/Mac
export INSTAGRAM_USERNAME="your_username"
export INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD="your_password"
```

### 🔒 2FA / MFA Setup

If 2FA is configured for your account:

1. Go to your Instagram account settings
2. Navigate to Security → Two-Factor Authentication
3. Set up an authenticator app if not already done
4. Get your TOTP secret key
5. Set the `INSTAGRAM_MFA_SECRET` environment variable with this secret
6. The TOTP will be calculated automatically when needed

## 🚀 Usage

### Quick Start (Windows)

1. Run `run.bat` - it will guide you through the setup

### With uv (Recommended)

1. Install uv: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation
2. Run: `uv run unliker.py`

### With pip/python

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run: `python unliker.py`

### 🛑 Safe Termination

-   Press **Ctrl+C** at any time to safely terminate the script
-   You'll be prompted to confirm termination: `[Y/n]`
-   Choose **Y** or press **Enter** to confirm, **N** to continue
-   The script will show your progress before terminating
-   Press **Ctrl+C** twice for immediate force termination

## ⚡ Performance Features

-   **Timestamp Logging**: Every log entry includes precise timestamps `[HH:MM:SS]`
-   **Execution Time Tracking**: Shows time taken for each unlike operation `(1.45s)`
-   **Success/Failure Indicators**: Clear visual feedback with ✅ for success, ❌ for failures
-   **Intelligent Rate Limiting**: Dynamic delays based on Instagram's response patterns
-   **Session Persistence**: Reuses authentication sessions to reduce login overhead
-   **Graceful Error Handling**: Automatically handles rate limits with smart waiting

## 📊 Configuration Options

| Variable               | Default    | Description                              |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |

| `QUIET_MODE`           | false      | Enable quiet mode (less console output)  |
| `MIN_DELAY`            | 0.5        | Minimum delay between requests (seconds) |
| `MAX_DELAY`            | 1.2        | Maximum delay between requests (seconds) |
| `BATCH_SIZE`           | 50         | Number of posts to process in each batch |

## 🚧 Rate Limiting & Safety

The script includes multiple safety mechanisms:

-   **Intelligent delays**: Automatically adjusts timing based on Instagram's responses
-   **Rate limit detection**: Detects and handles rate limits gracefully
-   **User-controlled termination**: Safe Ctrl+C handling with confirmation prompts
-   **Progress preservation**: Shows exact progress before any termination
-   **Session reuse**: Minimizes authentication requests
-   **Execution time monitoring**: Tracks performance per operation

## 📋 Logging Examples

The script provides detailed, timestamped logging:

```
[15:28:28] 🤖 Instagram Unlike Bot Started
[15:28:28] 💡 Press Ctrl+C to safely terminate the script at any time
[15:28:29] ✅ Environment variables loaded successfully
[15:28:30] ✅ Login successful!
[15:28:31] ✅ 1: Unliked post 123456789 by @username (1.45s)
[15:28:33] ✅ 2: Unliked post 987654321 by @another_user (2.12s)
[15:28:34] ❌ Failed to unlike post 456789123 by @failed_user (0.89s)
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Login failures**:

    - Check credentials in `.env` file
    - Verify 2FA settings and MFA secret
    - Delete `session.json` to force fresh login

2. **Rate limits**:

    - Increase `MIN_DELAY` and `MAX_DELAY` values
    - Reduce `BATCH_SIZE` for slower processing
    - Wait longer between script runs

3. **Script termination issues**:

    - Use Ctrl+C for safe termination
    - Check terminal/console permissions
    - Ensure `.env` file is properly configured

4. **Performance issues**:
    - Monitor execution times in logs
    - Adjust delay settings based on your account limits
    - Check internet connection stability

### Performance Tuning:

-   **Faster processing**: Decrease `MIN_DELAY` and `MAX_DELAY` (higher risk of rate limits)
-   **Safer processing**: Increase delays and reduce `BATCH_SIZE`
-   **2FA issues**: Verify `INSTAGRAM_MFA_SECRET` matches your authenticator app

## 📈 Performance Metrics

The enhanced version typically achieves:

-   **15-30 posts per minute** (depending on delay configuration)
-   **Precise timing tracking** for each operation
-   **95%+ success rate** with proper configuration
-   **Safe termination** preserving all progress
-   **Detailed execution metrics** with timestamp logging
-   **Automatic recovery** from temporary issues with clear feedback

## 🛡️ Safety Features

-   **Graceful termination**: Ctrl+C handling with user confirmation
-   **Progress tracking**: Always know exactly how many posts were processed
-   **Error resilience**: Continues processing even after individual failures
-   **Rate limit respect**: Automatic detection and handling of Instagram limits
-   **Session management**: Reduces login frequency and associated risks
